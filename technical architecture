Smart Contracts: Deploy smart contracts to handle ID issuance, validation, expiration, and permissionsâ€”automating much of the compliance logic and access control.

Secure Data Handling: Use encryption and zero-knowledge proofs wherever possible to protect personal and travel data while still providing necessary verification for authorities.

Interfaces: Provide mobile/web portals for entry points (airports, hotels, check-posts) to interact with the platform; travelers access their own ID via secure apps or QR codes.


#STEPS

Collect tourist data (KYC, itinerary, emergency contacts) at arrival points.

Validate identity locally using national ID/passport hardware or SDK.

Write verified tourist details to blockchain using dedicated smart contracts.

Generate a unique digital ID accessible via mobile device or QR scan, valid only for the trip duration.

On exit, the digital ID is automatically invalidated, protecting privacy.
