Enterprise vs Public Blockchain: For identity management, use an enterprise blockchain like Hyperledger Fabric or a permissioned variant of Ethereum to ensure strong data privacy, customizable access control, and pluggable consensus mechanisms.

Stakeholder Management: Identify government authorities, tourism boards, hotels, entry points, and the tourists themselves as network stakeholders, assigning roles and permission levels for distributed management.



Data Model and Storage
Decentralized Traveler Profiles: Store traveler data—KYC, trip details, emergency contacts—in an encrypted, tamper-proof format using decentralized identity standards like DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and verifiable credentials.

IPFS/Distributed File Storage: Hold actual documents or credentials in off-chain, distributed file systems (like IPFS), while only storing hashed references and metadata on the blockchain for greater security.



Smart Contracts
ID Issuance and Validation: Write smart contracts (chaincode) to handle the creation, issuance, and expiration of tourist digital IDs. Each contract automates the steps: onboarding, KYC validation, associating travel itinerary, and embedding emergency contacts.

Access Permissions: Smart contracts should define who can access which fields in the tourist’s ID and only release necessary information to verified entities (e.g., immigration officials, hotels).

Duration Management: Embed logic in smart contracts to restrict ID validity—ensuring automatic expiration and deletion after the authorized trip duration.
