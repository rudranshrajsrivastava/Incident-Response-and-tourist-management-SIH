Blockchain Backbone: Use a blockchain ledger (such as Ethereum or a private Hyperledger network) to store tourist IDs and associated metadata, ensuring data immutability and transparency.

ID Issuance: At the entry point, authorized personnel scan travel documents and register tourists. The platform validates identity via secure KYC integration and tags the digital ID with visit duration, itinerary, and emergency details.

KYC Integration: Connect the platform to national identity databases (Aadhaar/passport) and use on-premise verification or chip reading SDKs to prevent identity fraud and keep sensitive data protected on-site.

Trip & Emergency Info: The platform enables tourists to enter or approve itinerary data (travel provider integration, manual entry), as well as emergency contacts. These details are appended to the digital ID and written to the blockchain.

Access Control & Duration Management: The digital ID has an expiry date matching the declared visit duration. Access to the ID and associated services is restricted post-expiry.
